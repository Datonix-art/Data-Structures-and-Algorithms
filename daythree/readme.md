Big O Notation: (
    There are alot of existing algorithms, some are fast some are slow. Some use lost of memory.It can be hard to decide which algorithm is the best to solve a particular problem.

    "Big O" analysis (pronounced "Big Oh", not "Big Zero") is one way to compare the practicality of algorithms by classifying their time complexity.

    O(n) is very common - When the number of steps in an algorithm grows at the same rate as its input size, it's classified as O(n)

    O(nm) algorithm is similar to O(n^2) algorithm. if n=m then O(nm)=O(n^2) algorithm
