algorithms can be classified by two categories: (
    Polynomial time and Exponential time

    Polynomial algorithms are faster than exponential algorithms because they use less time and finish more quickly as the input size grows.

    Polynomal time is called P
    all the problems or tasks solved with P is more practical and quick then all the problems or tasks solved without P.

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

index-lookup if very fast becuase computer can jump straight into the indicated index's element in the list
