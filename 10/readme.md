A queue stores ordered items... again, kind of like a list, but again, like a stack, its design is more restrictive. A queue only allows items to be added to the tail of the queue and removed from the head of the queue.

It's called a "queue" because it behaves like a queue of people waiting in line to order coffee.

queu stack also reffered as FIFO
