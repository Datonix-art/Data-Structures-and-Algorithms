Algorithm (
    Algorithm is set of instructions that help us to solve the given problem or task.
    In Programming when we write the function that carries task to do some kind of task or solve 
    a problem that function represents Algorithm
 
    In short Algorithm is: (
        Defined  ( განსაზაღვრული ) : Theres a specific sequence of steps to perform a task,
        Unambiguous ( ცალსახა ) : there is a "correct" and "incorrect" interpretation of the steps for example: (
            "sort numbers in ascending order" -- correct,
            "sort numbers in nice way" 
        ) ,
        Implementable ( განხორციელებადი ): it can be executed using software and hardware for example : (
            "Check every number in universe" -- non-Implementable
            "check every number in the list" -- Implementable
        )
    )
